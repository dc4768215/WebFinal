      <p>History_Between_Ukraine_and_Russia</p>
      <p>The conflict between Ukraine and Russia is not a recent affair but something that has been going on since the declaration of their independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. <br>Their separation was a result of Russia’s imploding economy after the Cold War. <br>In an attempt to gain power over surrounding countries by investing lots of money into their military, the state of their economy took a massive hit so countries who didn’t want to be a part of the Soviet Union, one of them being Ukraine, took that as an opportunity to separate as Russia and their crippling economy would not be able to do anything about it. <br>Since then there have been multiple efforts from Russia to try and get Ukraine back from making them elect a puppet president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2010 to secretly sending Russian military into Ukraine military to fight separatists in 2014. <br>Ukraine’s slow attempts at trying to join NATO, who would safeguard their freedom and security, has always been a lingering threat to Russia and are now taking action by invading their Ukraine starting the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. <br>For more information look through the sources under me.

      <p>Ukraine and its citizens have been under attack since Russia’s aggressive invasion.
Russia’s military front started along the North and South borders of Ukraine launching out of Belarus targeting the city of Kyiv, as well as a northeastern front launched at the city of Kharkiv. <br>The southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearhead fronts including a southern front, originating in Crimea, and a separate probative southeastern front, launched at the cities of Luhansk and Donbas. <br>Since then they’ve been making their way through the country destroying buildings and homes with a fatality of 3,404 civilians as of now (May 2022). <br>Ukrainians have been seeking asylum in neighboring countries like Poland, Romania, Moldova, Hungary, and Slovakia hoping for safety. <br>For more information look through the sources under me.</p>

      <p>Russia too has been suffering from the effects of the war. <br>Companies from around the world have been cutting ties with Russia which has been taking a toll on their economy. <br>To name a few tech companies such as Nokia, Intel, and Google, travel companies: Airbus and Boeing, food companies: McDonalds and Carlsberg, and manufacturing companies: Renault and Caterpillar are all working towards putting a halt on their services in Russia. <br>As a result, prices have been raised for its citizens due to how scarce products have become. <br>Additionally, despite Putin’s efforts to convince his citizens to be in agreement with his decisions, many have protested against the invasion leading to their arrests. <br>For more information look through the sources under me.</p>
